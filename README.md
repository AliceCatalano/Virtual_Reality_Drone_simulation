# Virtual_Reality_Drone_simulation

This is the repository cointaining just the [OneDrive](https://unigeit-my.sharepoint.com/personal/s5165612_studenti_unige_it/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fs5165612%5Fstudenti%5Funige%5Fit%2FDocuments%2FVR%5FJAHY%5FProject&ga=1) link to the actual simulation package, this is due to the github size limitation.  

## How to run:  
After downloading the project, open the project file from [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5) by selecting the file *drones.uproject*, this will start a the *demo scene*, press the *play button*. This will spawn a player in third person view which can move around in the environment with *wasd* and the *mouse*. Furthermore, looking at any of the drones in the environment the widget shows the drone ID, position, orientation, mission number and drone camera. While looking at any of the drones pressing 1, 2 or 3 can change the drone's current mission. Further documentation can be found in the brief report in this repository.
